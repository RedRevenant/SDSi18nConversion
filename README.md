# SDSi18nConversion

The i18n version of RiceHit's Seven Deadly Sins (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15100) <br />
For version 1.6 - 3.6.7 <br />
Download files and replace the original text with mine when prompted. <br />
Also, please give credit to me (or at least link to this github page) if you decide to translate SDS off of this! <br />
 <br />
A note: the default.json file is empty, so copy and paste text from the split files to the default.json file! <br />

Will most likely be rendered obsolete by the official i18n format update in a future update
